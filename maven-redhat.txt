The first thing we need to do is to download the Maven tar file and untar it to a shared location on the workstation


wget http://mirrors.gigenet.com/apache/maven/maven-3/3.0.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.5-bin.tar.gz

su -c "tar -zxvf apache-maven-3.0.5-bin.tar.gz -C /opt/"

Setup the Maven Environment Variables in shared profile. The next step is to setup the Maven environment variables 
in a shared profile so all users on the system will get them import at login time. 

su -c "vi /etc/profile.d/maven.sh"

# Add the following lines to maven.sh

export M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.0.5
export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
PATH=$M2:$PATH 

mvn -version


jdk
